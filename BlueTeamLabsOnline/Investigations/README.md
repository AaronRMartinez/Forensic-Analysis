## Forensic Analysis

### Scenario

NYC Police received information that a gang of attackers has entered the city and are planning to detonate an explosive device. Law enforcement have begun investigating all leads to determine whether this is true or a hoax.

Persons of interest were taken into custody, and one additional suspect named ‘Zerry’ was detained while officers raided his house. During the search they found one laptop, collected the digital evidence, and sent it to NYC digital forensics division.

Police believe Zerry is directly associated with the gang and are analyzing his device to uncover any information about the potential attack.
